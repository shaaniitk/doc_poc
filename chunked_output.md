Signal processing is a foundational discipline in modern engineering, enabling the extraction, transformation, and interpretation of information from raw data. This document presents a comprehensive overview of advanced signal processing techniques, with a focus on the Dynamic Adaptive Wavelet Filter (DAWF) and its applications in biomedical and communications engineering. Key contributions include a new adaptive thresholding method, robust testing protocols, and a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art filters. The DAWF is benchmarked against both classical and modern approaches, demonstrating superior performance in non-stationary noise environments. The results are validated using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including EEG and radar signals. The field of signal processing has evolved rapidly, driven by the increasing complexity of real-world signals and the demand for higher fidelity in data analysis. Traditional methods such as Fourier and Z-Transforms provide powerf...
