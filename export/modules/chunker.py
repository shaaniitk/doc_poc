"""[1mðŸ”§ INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT CHUNKING MODULE

This module implements sophisticated document segmentation with LLM-enhanced
boundary detection and semantic understanding. It transforms raw documents
into intelligently structured chunks ready for processing.

ðŸ§  INTELLIGENCE FEATURES:
- Semantic chunk boundary detection using LLM
- Content type classification (equations, tables, paragraphs)
- Dependency-aware chunking for related content
- LaTeX environment preservation
- Adaptive merging based on content relationships

ðŸ“Š KEY CAPABILITIES:
- Regex-based section extraction from LaTeX documents
- Granular content parsing (preserves tables, equations, figures)
- LLM-driven optimal chunk boundary identification
- Content dependency analysis for intelligent grouping
- Multi-strategy chunk enhancement and optimization
