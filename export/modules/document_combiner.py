"""[1mðŸš€ REVOLUTIONARY DOCUMENT COMBINER MODULE

This module implements the breakthrough chunk-level LLM-dependent document augmentation
system. Unlike traditional section-level merging, this system:

ðŸ§  SEMANTIC INTELLIGENCE:
- Analyzes individual chunks for content meaning and purpose
- Maps chunks to original document sections based on semantic relevance
- Preserves original document structure while intelligently adding content
- Creates new sections only when content truly doesn't fit existing structure

ðŸŽ¯ KEY INNOVATIONS:
- Chunk-level granularity instead of coarse section-level mapping
- LLM-driven relevance scoring with confidence thresholds
- Conservative augmentation that respects document architecture
- Batch processing for efficiency while maintaining quality

ðŸ“Š PROCESSING FLOW:
1. Extract chunks from augmentation document (preserves original intact)
2. LLM analyzes each chunk against original document sections
