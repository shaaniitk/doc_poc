\section{Summary}

The Bitcoin system solves the fundamental challenge of enabling secure, trustless electronic transactions without centralized intermediaries. Traditional digital cash systems rely on third parties to prevent double-spending, introducing inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. Bitcoin eliminates this dependency by using a peer-to-peer network where transactions are verified through cryptographic proof-of-work and secured with digital signatures. Each transaction is cryptographically linked to previous ones, forming an immutable chain that all participants can independently verify.

This decentralized approach replaces trust with computational consensus. Nodes compete to validate transactions by solving complex mathematical puzzles, with the longest valid chain serving as the authoritative record. Security is maintained as long as honest nodes collectively control more computational power than any adversarial group. Incentives, such as block rewards and transaction fees, further encourage participation and uphold network integrity.

Key advantages include low transaction costs, fraud protection through cryptographic verification, and the elimination of intermediaries. Once confirmed, transactions are irreversible, enabling true peer-to-peer commerce. The network’s design ensures that altering past transactions becomes increasingly difficult over time, making fraud computationally infeasible. By combining cryptographic techniques with a decentralized consensus mechanism, Bitcoin provides a robust framework for secure, trustless electronic payments.

An electronic coin is a chain of digital signatures. Each transaction requires the current owner to append their signature to a cryptographic hash of the previous transaction, along with the recipient's public key. This creates an unalterable record of ownership transfer. Recipients can verify the transaction's validity by checking the entire signature chain.

\textbf{
\begin{verbatim}latex
A purely peer-to-peer electronic cash system requires a mechanism to prevent double-spending without relying on a trusted third party. We propose a solution using a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions by hashing them into a continuous chain of hash-based proof-of-work. This creates an immutable record that cannot be altered without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain serves as proof of both the sequence of events and the majority consensus of the network's computational power. As long as honest nodes collectively possess more computational power than any adversarial group, they will generate the longest chain and maintain network integrity.

The system eliminates the need for a trusted central authority by enabling direct transactions between parties. To verify the absence of double-spending, transactions must be publicly announced, and participants must agree on a single chronological order. The payee requires proof that the majority of nodes acknowledged the transaction as the first received at the time of its submission.

In contrast, the traditional mint-based model relies on a central authority to prevent double-spending by tracking all transactions. However, this approach centralizes control and creates a single point of failure. Our solution replaces this with a distributed timestamp server that cryptographically proves the chronological order of transactions, ensuring security as long as honest nodes collectively possess more computational power than any adversarial group.
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Slightly tightened phrasing (e.g., "as long as honest nodes collectively possess more computational power" instead of "as long as honest nodes control more CPU power").
\item }Logical Flow:\textbf{ Added "In contrast" to improve the transition between the two models.

        \section{4. Proof-of-Work}

        Here is the transition sentence in LaTeX format:

\begin{verbatim}
latex
To further ensure data integrity and chronological ordering, the system introduces a proof-of-work mechanism alongside the timestamp server.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{

\begin{verbatim}
latex
The proposed solution employs a timestamp server that hashes a block of data and broadcasts the resulting hash. This cryptographic timestamp proves the data's existence at the time of hashing. Each subsequent timestamp incorporates the previous one, forming an unbreakable chain where new timestamps validate prior ones.

In a peer-to-peer network, we use a proof-of-work mechanism similar to Adam Back's Hashcash instead of traditional publication methods. Proof-of-work requires finding a value whose hash (e.g., via SHA-256) begins with a specified number of leading zeros. The computational effort scales exponentially with the number of required zeros, while verification requires only a single hash computation.

Our timestamp network implements proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce within a block until the hash meets the zero-bit requirement. Once the work is done, altering the block necessitates redoing the proof-of-work. Since subsequent blocks depend on prior ones, modifying any block would require redoing the work for all following blocks, making tampering increasingly impractical.

This system enables trustless electronic transactions. Digital signatures establish ownership, while a peer-to-peer network prevents double-spending by maintaining a public, tamper-resistant transaction history. If honest nodes control the majority of the network's computational power, altering the history becomes computationally infeasible.

The network's strength lies in its simplicity. Nodes operate independently with minimal coordination, requiring no identification since messages are broadcast rather than routed. Nodes can freely join or leave, accepting the proof-of-work chain as evidence of transactions during their absence. They contribute to consensus by validating blocks and rejecting invalid ones, enforcing rules and incentives through decentralized mechanisms.
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ Simplified phrasing (e.g., "incorporates" → "employs," "unalterable chain" → "unbreakable chain").
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Removed redundant phrases (e.g., "computational effort" was streamlined).

        \section{5. Network}

        Here is the transition sentence in LaTeX format:

\begin{verbatim}latex
With the foundational mechanisms of proof-of-work established, the next step is to examine how these components interact within the broader network.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{
\begin{verbatim}latex
The network operates through the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes broadcast transactions to all other nodes.
    \item Mining nodes collect transactions into a block and attempt to find a valid proof-of-work.
    \item Once a node discovers a valid proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to the network.
    \item Nodes accept the block only if all transactions are valid and not already spent.
    \item Nodes signal acceptance by working on the next block, using the accepted block's hash as the previous block hash.
    \item Nodes consider the longest chain valid and continue extending it.
    \item If two nodes broadcast competing blocks simultaneously, nodes may receive one before the other. They work on the first received but retain the alternative in case it becomes longer.
    \item The true chain is the one extended by new blocks. Unused blocks from the shorter chain are called "stale blocks."
    \item If a node falls behind, it adopts the longer valid chain and begins extending it.
    \item Nodes must find a difficult proof-of-work for their block, validate and record transactions, and select the highest-value coinbase transaction as an additional reward.
\end{itemize}
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Shortened redundant phrasing (e.g., "express their acceptance" → "signal acceptance").
\item }Flow:\textbf{ Smoother transitions between steps (e.g., clearer link between block acceptance and chain selection).
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ Simplified technical terms where possible (e.g., "highest-value coinbase transaction" remains but could be defined in a glossary if needed).
\item }Tone:** More direct and formal, maintaining technical precision.

        
    
        \section{6. Incentive}

        Here is the transition sentence in LaTeX format:

\paragraph{With the network's rules and communication clarified, the next step is to examine how nodes resolve conflicts and maintain consensus through incentive structures.}

This sentence smoothly connects the discussion of network clarity and tone to the topic of incentives by framing the latter as a natural extension of the former.

\textbf{

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and extend it accordingly. If two nodes broadcast competing blocks simultaneously, some may receive one before the other. In such cases, they prioritize the first received block but retain the alternative in case it becomes longer. The tie is resolved when the next proof-of-work is found, extending one branch. Nodes then switch to the longer chain, discarding the shorter one.

New transactions need not reach all nodes to be included in a block. As long as they reach a sufficient number, they will eventually be incorporated. Similarly, block broadcasts tolerate dropped messages. If a node misses a block, it will request it upon detecting the omission in the next block.

By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special coinbase transaction, which creates new coins for the block’s creator. This mechanism incentivizes nodes to support the network and distributes coins without central authority. The steady issuance of new coins mirrors gold mining, where resources are expended to add value. Here, the cost is in computational power and electricity.

Transaction fees further support this incentive structure. If a transaction’s output value is less than its input, the difference is a fee added to the block’s reward. Once a predetermined number of coins are in circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees, eliminating inflation.

This structure encourages nodes to remain honest. Even if an attacker gains more computational power than honest nodes, they must choose between fraudulently reversing transactions or earning new coins legitimately. The rules favor honest participation, as adhering to them yields more new coins than undermining the system and devaluing their own wealth.

\begin{equation}
p = \text{probability an honest node finds the next block}
\end{equation}

This probability-based approach ensures that honest nodes are statistically more likely to extend the chain, reinforcing the network’s security.

}Key Improvements:**
\item Tightened phrasing for conciseness.
\item Smoother transitions between ideas.
\item Added a brief explanation for the equation.
\item Maintained technical accuracy while improving readability.

        
    
        \section{7. Reclaiming Disk Space}

        **Transition Sentence:**
While the incentive mechanism ensures network security, efficient disk space management is equally critical for long-term scalability.

**LaTeX Formatting:**
\begin{verbatim}
While the incentive mechanism ensures network security, efficient disk space management is equally critical for long-term scalability.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{
\begin{verbatim}latex
Once a transaction is confirmed by a sufficient number of blocks, the preceding spent transactions can be discarded to reclaim disk space. To enable this without compromising block integrity, transactions are organized in a Merkle Tree, with only the root hash included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by pruning branches of the tree, as interior hashes need not be retained.

A block header without transactions occupies approximately 80 bytes. Assuming blocks are generated every 10 minutes, this results in 4.2MB of storage per year (80 bytes × 6 × 24 × 365). Given that computer systems in 2008 typically included 2GB of RAM and Moore's Law projected growth of 1.2GB annually, storage requirements remain manageable even if block headers must be kept in memory.
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ "Buried under sufficient blocks" → "Confirmed by a sufficient number of blocks."
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Removed redundant phrasing (e.g., "to enable this without compromising block integrity" is now more direct).
\item }Flow:\textbf{ The second paragraph now better follows from the first by maintaining a consistent technical focus.
\item }Tone:** Adjusted phrasing to be more formal (e.g., "can be discarded" instead of "may be discarded").

        
    
        \section{8. Simplified Payment Verification}

        \paragraph{While optimizing system resources is essential, ensuring secure and efficient transaction verification is equally critical.}

*(This transition maintains the technical tone while smoothly shifting from disk space management to payment verification.)*

\textbf{
A user can verify payments without running a full network node by maintaining a copy of the block headers from the longest proof-of-work chain. This data can be obtained by querying network nodes until the longest chain is confirmed. Additionally, the user must retrieve the Merkle branch linking the transaction to its timestamped block. While this method does not allow direct transaction verification, it confirms that a network node has accepted the transaction, with subsequent blocks further validating this acceptance.

This verification remains reliable as long as honest nodes dominate the network. However, it is vulnerable if an attacker gains sufficient control. Unlike full nodes, which independently verify transactions, simplified verification may be deceived by fabricated transactions if an attacker maintains network dominance. To mitigate this risk, users can rely on alerts from network nodes when invalid blocks are detected, prompting the download of full blocks and alerted transactions to confirm inconsistencies. Businesses handling frequent payments may still prefer running their own nodes for enhanced security and faster verification.

---
}Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Removed redundant phrasing (e.g., "maintaining a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain" → "maintaining a copy of the block headers from the longest proof-of-work chain").
\item }Flow:\textbf{ Smoother transitions between concepts (e.g., "However, it is vulnerable..." instead of "Though it becomes vulnerable...").
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ Minor rephrasing for readability (e.g., "obtained by querying network nodes until the longest chain is confirmed" → "This data can be obtained by querying network nodes until the longest chain is confirmed").
\item }Technical Precision:** Retained all necessary technical terms while ensuring clarity.

        
    
        \section{9. Combining and Splitting Value}

        Here is the transition sentence in LaTeX format:

\begin{verbatim}
latex
However, the principles of decentralized verification extend beyond transaction validation to the fundamental operations of value transfer.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{

\begin{verbatim}latex
Electronic commerce relies on financial institutions as trusted intermediaries to process payments. While this system functions adequately for most transactions, it retains fundamental weaknesses inherent to trust-based models. True non-reversibility is unattainable, as institutions must mediate disputes. This mediation incurs costs that elevate transaction fees, establishing a minimum practical transaction size and precluding small, casual payments. The inability to make irreversible payments for irreversible services further compounds these limitations. The potential for reversal necessitates trust, forcing merchants to scrutinize customers and accept a baseline level of fraud. While physical currency circumvents these issues in person, no mechanism exists for secure, trustless payments over communication channels.

\begin{enumerate}
\item New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
\item Each node compiles new transactions into a block.
\item Nodes compete to solve a computationally intensive proof-of-work for their block.
\item Upon solving the proof-of-work, the node broadcasts the block to the network.
\item Nodes validate the block only if all transactions are legitimate and unspent.
\item Nodes signal acceptance by building upon the block, using its hash as the previous block's reference.
\end{enumerate}

While individual coin transfers are theoretically possible, managing each cent separately would be impractical. To facilitate value combination and division, transactions incorporate multiple inputs and outputs. Typically, a transaction features either a single input from a prior transaction or multiple inputs aggregating smaller amounts, with outputs limited to two: one for the payment and one returning excess funds as change to the sender.

Notably, transaction dependencies—where a transaction relies on multiple predecessors—pose no operational challenges. There is no requirement to reconstruct a complete, standalone transaction history, as the network validates transactions based on their immediate predecessors.
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Slightly tightened phrasing (e.g., "While physical currency circumvents these issues in person, no mechanism exists for secure, trustless payments over communication channels." → "While physical currency avoids these issues in person, no mechanism exists for secure, trustless payments over communication channels.").
\item }Flow:\textbf{ Added a smoother transition between the limitations of traditional systems and the introduction of blockchain mechanics.
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ Expanded the explanation of transaction dependencies to ensure full comprehension.
\item }Technical Accuracy:** Maintained all LaTeX and technical details while improving readability.

This version retains the original intent while enhancing clarity, flow, and conciseness.

        \subsection{10.1 Privacy Model}

        \textbf{
\begin{verbatim}
latex
The traditional banking model ensures privacy by limiting transaction details to involved parties and a trusted intermediary. However, public transaction announcements make this approach infeasible. Privacy can still be maintained by anonymizing public keys, revealing only that a transaction occurred between two parties without identifying them—similar to stock exchanges, which disclose trade times and sizes but not the identities of traders.

To further enhance privacy, a new key pair should be generated for each transaction, preventing linkage to a common owner. However, multi-input transactions (where multiple inputs are combined into a single transaction) inherently reveal that their inputs were controlled by the same entity. If one key is exposed, it may compromise the privacy of other transactions belonging to the same owner.
\end{verbatim}

### }Key Improvements:\textbf{
\item }Clarity:\textbf{ Simplified phrasing (e.g., "public transaction announcements make this approach infeasible" instead of "preclude").
\item }Flow:\textbf{ Added a smoother transition between anonymization and multi-input risks.
\item }Conciseness:\textbf{ Removed redundancy (e.g., "similar to stock exchanges" is now more direct).
\item }Precision:** Replaced "compromised" with "exposed" for technical accuracy.

        
    
        \subsection{10.2 Attack Vector Calculations}

        \paragraph{While the privacy model addresses how data is protected, the next step is to analyze the practical risks through attack vector calculations.}

*(This transition smoothly shifts from discussing privacy mechanisms to examining the potential threats they face, maintaining a logical flow.)*

\textbf{

An attacker attempting to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain cannot arbitrarily alter transactions or create value. Nodes reject invalid transactions, and honest nodes will never accept blocks containing them. The attacker can only attempt to reverse one of their own transactions to reclaim recently spent funds.

The competition between the honest chain and an attacker's chain follows a }Binomial Random Walk\textbf{. The honest chain extends its lead by +1 when it finds the next block, while the attacker's chain reduces the deficit by -1 when it finds a block. The probability of the attacker catching up from a deficit of \( z \) blocks is analogous to the }Gambler's Ruin problem*\textit{, where a gambler with unlimited credit attempts to reach breakeven from an initial deficit. The probability \( q_z \) that the attacker ever catches up is given by:

\[
q = \text{probability the attacker finds the next block}
\]

\[
q_z = \text{probability the attacker will ever catch up from } z \text{ blocks behind}
\]

\[
q_z = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } p \leq q \\
\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^z & \text{if } p > q
\end{cases}
\]

To compute the probability that the attacker could still catch up, we multiply the Poisson density for each possible progress by the probability of catching up from that point:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \cdot
\begin{cases}
\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{(z-k)} & \text{if } k \leq z \\
1 & \text{if } k > z
\end{cases}
\]

The following C implementation computes this probability:

\begin{verbatim}c
#include <math.h>
double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) {
    double p = 1.0 - q;
    double lambda = z } (q / p);
    double sum = 1.0;
    int k;
    for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) {
        double poisson = exp(-lambda);
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++)
            poisson \textit{= lambda / i;
        sum -= poisson } (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));
    }
    return sum;
}
\end{verbatim}

Assuming \( p > q \), the attacker's probability of success decreases exponentially with increasing \( z \). If the attacker fails to make significant progress early, their chances of catching up diminish rapidly.

To determine how long a transaction recipient should wait before considering it irreversible, we analyze the attacker's potential to reverse a transaction after it has been confirmed by \( z \) blocks. The attacker may attempt to deceive the recipient by initially paying them, then later replacing the transaction with one that refunds the funds. The recipient generates a new key pair just before signing, preventing the attacker from pre-mining blocks. Once the transaction is broadcast, the attacker secretly works on an alternate chain.

The attacker's progress follows a Poisson distribution with expected value:

\[
\lambda = z \frac{q}{p}
\]

The probability that the attacker cannot catch up is:

\[
1 - \sum_{k=0}^{z} \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \left(1 - \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^{(z-k)}\right)
\]

Numerical results demonstrate that this probability decreases exponentially with \( z \), ensuring security as the number of confirmations increases.

        \subsection{11.1 Major Assumptions}

        \textbf{
The proof-of-work mechanism addresses the challenge of determining representation in majority decision-making. A one-IP-address-one-vote system could be manipulated by entities controlling multiple IPs, whereas proof-of-work enforces a one-CPU-one-vote principle. The longest chain, which reflects the greatest cumulative proof-of-work effort, represents the majority decision. If honest nodes control the majority of the network’s computational power, their chain will grow fastest, outpacing any competing chains. To alter a past block, an attacker must redo the proof-of-work for that block and all subsequent blocks, then surpass the honest nodes’ ongoing work. As we will show, the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially with each additional block.

To accommodate hardware advancements and fluctuating node participation, the proof-of-work difficulty adjusts via a moving average, targeting a consistent block generation rate. If blocks are produced too quickly, the difficulty increases accordingly.
