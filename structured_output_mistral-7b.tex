\section*{1. Introduction}


\section{Introduction}

The field of signal processing has undergone significant evolution, propelled by the escalating complexity of real-world signals and the growing demand for enhanced fidelity in data analysis. While traditional methodologies, such as Fourier and Z-Transforms, offer robust frameworks for frequency-domain analysis, their efficacy diminishes in non-stationary environments. Recent advancements, particularly in wavelet-based techniques and adaptive filtering, have expanded the horizons of signal processing research and applications. This document seeks to synthesize theoretical rigor with practical implementation, providing a comprehensive foundation for the development and analysis of adaptive signal processing techniques. The core problem addressed herein pertains to the limitations of conventional methods in dynamic signal environments, necessitating innovative approaches to achieve superior performance. The scope of this work encompasses both the mathematical formalism underlying these techniques and their practical deployment, with the overarching objective of advancing the state-of-the-art in signal processing methodologies.
