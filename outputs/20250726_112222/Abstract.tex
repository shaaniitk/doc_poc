This paper introduces a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables direct transactions between parties without relying on a trusted third party. The system addresses the double-spending problem by utilizing a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions into a chain of hash-based proof-of-work. This chain forms an immutable record, with the longest chain representing the consensus view of the network. The network's security is maintained as long as a majority of the CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, which generate the longest chain and outpace any potential attackers. The system requires minimal structure, with messages broadcast on a best-effort basis and nodes freely joining and leaving the network, always accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as the valid record of transactions.
