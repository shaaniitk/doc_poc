### Summary

This document presents a novel approach to electronic cash systems, aiming to enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a trusted third party. The proposed solution addresses the double-spending problem through a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions using a chain of hash-based proof-of-work. This chain forms an immutable record of transactions, with the longest chain representing the consensus view of the network.

The system leverages the computational power of the network to ensure security. As long as honest nodes control the majority of CPU power, they will generate the longest chain, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to alter past transactions. The network operates with minimal structure, allowing nodes to join and leave freely while maintaining consensus through the proof-of-work mechanism.

The document highlights the limitations of traditional financial systems, which rely on trusted third parties and suffer from issues such as transaction costs, fraud, and the inability to make completely non-reversible payments. The proposed system eliminates these issues by using cryptographic proof instead of trust, enabling secure and irreversible transactions.

Key contributions include the definition of an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures, the use of a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending, and the implementation of a proof-of-work system to ensure the integrity and chronological order of transactions. The system also introduces incentives for nodes to support the network, such as the creation of new coins and transaction fees, which help maintain the security and stability of the network.

The document concludes by discussing the robustness of the network, its resistance to attacks, and the probability of an attacker successfully altering the transaction history. It demonstrates that the system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. The proposed solution offers a promising alternative to traditional financial systems, enabling secure, decentralized, and efficient electronic transactions.
