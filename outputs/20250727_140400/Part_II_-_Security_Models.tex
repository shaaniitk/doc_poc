We define several security models for blockchain analysis:

\begin{equation}
\text{Security Level} = \min(\text{Cryptographic Security}, \text{Consensus Security}, \text{Network Security})
\end{equation}

equation

The overall security of a blockchain system is determined by its weakest component. This necessitates a holistic approach to security analysis.

\textbf{Byzantine Fault Tolerance Model:}
The system can tolerate up to $f$ Byzantine (malicious) nodes out of $3f+1$ total nodes.

\begin{equation}
\text{Safety} \Leftrightarrow \text{Honest nodes} \geq 2f+1
\end{equation}

equation

\textbf{Proof-of-Work Security Model:}
Security is based on computational power majority assumption.

\begin{equation}
P_{\text{attack success}} = \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)^k
\end{equation}

equation

Where $q$ is attacker hash rate, $p$ is honest hash rate, and $k$ is confirmation depth.
