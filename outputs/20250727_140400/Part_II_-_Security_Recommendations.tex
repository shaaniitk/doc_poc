Based on our analysis, we recommend the following security measures:

1. \textbf{Multi-layered Security}: Implement defense in depth
2. \textbf{Formal Verification}: Use mathematical proofs for critical components
3. \textbf{Regular Audits}: Conduct periodic security assessments
4. \textbf{Incident Response}: Develop comprehensive response procedures

\begin{equation}
\text{Risk} = \text{Threat} \times \text{Vulnerability} \times \text{Impact}
\end{equation}
