Blockchain systems face numerous attack vectors that can compromise their security and functionality. We categorize these attacks into several classes:

\textbf{Consensus Attacks:}
- 51% Attack: Controlling majority of network hash power
- Selfish Mining: Strategic block withholding
- Nothing-at-Stake: Validator incentive misalignment

\textbf{Network Attacks:}
- Eclipse Attack: Isolating nodes from the network
- Sybil Attack: Creating multiple fake identities
- DDoS Attack: Overwhelming network resources

\textbf{Cryptographic Attacks:}
- Hash Collision: Finding hash function weaknesses
- Signature Forgery: Breaking digital signature schemes
- Quantum Attacks: Future quantum computing threats
