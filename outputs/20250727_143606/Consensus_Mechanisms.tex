Different consensus mechanisms provide varying security guarantees:

\textbf{Proof-of-Work (PoW):}
- Security: High (energy-based)
- Scalability: Low
- Energy Efficiency: Poor

\textbf{Proof-of-Stake (PoS):}
- Security: Medium (stake-based)
- Scalability: Medium
- Energy Efficiency: Good

\textbf{Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT):}
- Security: High (deterministic)
- Scalability: Low
- Energy Efficiency: Excellent
