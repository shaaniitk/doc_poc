A peer-to-peer electronic cash system enables direct online payments between parties without financial institutions. Digital signatures address part of the solution, but a trusted third party is still needed to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution using a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions into a chain of hash-based proof-of-work, creating an unalterable record. The longest chain proves the sequence of events and originates from the majority of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control the majority of CPU power, they generate the longest chain, outpacing any attackers. The network requires minimal structure, with messages broadcast on a best-effort basis, and nodes can freely join and leave, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of transactions during their absence.
